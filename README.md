# Football_Data_Project

visualisations.py loads the Manchester United and Chelsea CSVs, flattens/cleans the columns, and picks a 4-3-3 starting XI for each side based on minutes by position (GK, four defenders, three midfielders, three forwards). It then builds per-90 attacking metrics (e.g., Goals, Assists, xG, xAG, G+A), aggregates team/lineup averages, and reads match-by-match data to filter Premier League fixtures and retrieve key stats (GF, GA, xG, xGA). With those inputs, it generates comparison bar charts and correlation plots, prints the chosen lineups and summary tables, and produces a lightweight xG-blended match prediction (including likely scorers) before displaying the figures with Matplotlib.
